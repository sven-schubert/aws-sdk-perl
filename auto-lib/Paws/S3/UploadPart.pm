=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::UploadPart - Arguments for method UploadPart on Paws::S3

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method UploadPart on the 
Amazon Simple Storage Service service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method UploadPart.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to UploadPart.

As an example:

  $service_obj->UploadPart(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Body => Str

Object data.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Bucket => Str

Name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.



=head2 ContentLength => Int

Size of the body in bytes. This parameter is useful when the size of
the body cannot be determined automatically.



=head2 ContentMD5 => Str

The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the part data.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Key => Str

Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> PartNumber => Int

Part number of part being uploaded. This is a positive integer between
1 and 10,000.



=head2 RequestPayer => Str



Valid values are: C<"requester">

=head2 SSECustomerAlgorithm => Str

Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (e.g.,
AES256).



=head2 SSECustomerKey => Str

Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in
encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is
discarded; Amazon does not store the encryption key. The key must be
appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header. This must be
the same encryption key specified in the initiate multipart upload
request.



=head2 SSECustomerKeyMD5 => Str

Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to
ensure the encryption key was transmitted without error.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> UploadId => Str

Upload ID identifying the multipart upload whose part is being
uploaded.
